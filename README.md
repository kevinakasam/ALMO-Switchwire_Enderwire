# Almo - Alternative Motormounts for the Switchwire and Enderwire

A while ago I designed some new Motormounts for the [SwitchThread](https://github.com/kevinakasam/SwitchThread) as the tension mechanism didn't work that well on a 1515 profile. The new ones are working really well, so I scaled them up to for the [Switchwire](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Switchwire) and [Enderwire](https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW).

I got the idea for the tension mechanism from MasturMynd's [Pandora Gantry](https://github.com/MasturMynd/Pandora). It did a great job on my V0 and so it does in these Motormounts. The design is pretty simple and should be a drop in replacement for the original mounts. **The files aren't tested yet!!**

### BOM
```
Per side:
    4x M3 Voron spec Heatinserts (you can substitute 3 of them with hexnuts by printing the _hexnut files)
    3x M5x8mm (Enderwire needs 5)
    3x M5 t-nut
    1x M3x40-50mm (for the tension mechanism)
    2x M3x25mm (to mount the Nema 17)
    1x M3x10-12 (to mount the Nema 17)
    3x M3x12-16mm (for securing the tensioner in place)
    3x M3 washers (for the three screws above)
```
